# Video Game Project

Due date: N1: 3/5 :: L2: 3/6

When you finish, add links here and submit one link to your project (github.com/<username>/<your_project>):
* Final Code (1 per group)
* Playtesting Video (1 per group)

In this project, you will design and build a video game.  I recommend that you design a game like; snake, frogger, or pacman, but your game choice is up to you.  We will use github to manage our work and collaborate, and we will also use the curses library to enhance our terminal to simulate a video game console.  To get started, follow the link below to fork the project repository, be sure to take a look at the example project as well.

## Project Requirements:

| Part I: Planning & Design (15 pts) |
|----------|
* Decide on a game idea and core goal
* Game rules and player actions are written or sketched out
* Main objects (player, obstacles, goals, enemies, etc.) are identified
* Sketch a simple plan showing how the game will work step-by-step 

| Part II: Install Curses and Print Game Elements (15 pts) |
|----------|
* Get Curses Installed
* Store Game Icons in a dictionary
* Successfully print those icons onto a game board
* Adjust coloration so the board looks like a game console

| Part III: Establish Movement (15 pts) |
|----------|
* Implement player movement (I suggest W/A/S/D or arrow keys).
* Prevent the player from moving off the board or into obstacles.
* Track total moves (for high-score).
* Display the updated board after each move.


| Part IV: Add Dynamic Elements (15 pts) |

* Incorporate collectible or enemy logic to the display board function


| Part V: Build Collision Logic (20 pts) |
|----------|
* Build out collision logic for enemies or collectibles.
* Apply win/loss condition logic
* Game over screen is displayed with high score/feedback of some kind.

| Part VI: Reflection + Demo Video (20 pts) |
|----------|
* Record a screen-share of another student playing your game
* Display a screen-share of your code and talk through your code-base
* Take a moment to describe at least 3 portions of your code that you are most proud of
* Both partners speak during the screen-share.

| Optional Bonus (+10 pts / each) --> Indicate bonus work in your video |
|----------|
* Build out special abilities or power-ups for the character in your game. 
* Create multiple levels where the game increases in difficulty.
* Add a ‘play again’ option
